The former Downing Street adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/boris-johnson-adviser-quits-over-race-and-eugenics-writings\" title=\"\">Andrew Sabisky</a>, a self-proclaimed political “forecaster”, argued that forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/16/tory-aide-wants-enforced-contraception-to-curb-pregnancies\" title=\"\">long-term contraception</a> might help tackle the problem of a “permanent underclass”, or as early eugenicists termed it, the “residuum”. He also suggested that black people had innately lower average IQs. Downing Street initially stood by Sabisky’s appointment, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/no-10-refuses-to-comment-on-pms-views-of-racial-iq\" title=\"\">No 10 refusing to comment</a> on whether Boris Johnson agreed with his views. After intense media scrutiny, Sabisky announced on Twitter that he was resigning. Who could have guessed that putting out a job call for weirdos and misfits would have led to this?</p> <p>Sabisky is joined by the likes of Toby Young, the rightwing journalist who has made the case for what he calls “<a href=\"https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/09/fall-meritocracy/\" title=\"\">progressive eugenics</a>”, or allowing poor parents to engineer their children in utero with intellectual and physiological capacities that would compensate for their disadvantaged start in life. Cummings has likewise suggested that human capacities are the result of heritable traits rather than external factors such as education or social mobility; he previously stated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/15/dominic-cummings-wealth-genes-inequality\" title=\"\">70% of an individual’s cognitive capacity is genetic</a> (a wild misinterpretation of how biology works, according to even the most hereditarian of scientists). Even Johnson has displayed a fondness for biologically determinist arguments. In 2013, as London mayor, he suggested that some people would struggle to get on in life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/28/boris-johnson-iq-comments\" title=\"\">because of their low IQs</a>. These ideas reflect a type of thinking that dates back more than a century, when powerful individuals and social reformists pathologised poverty and inequality, framing them as biological problems innate to the poor and oppressed.</p> <p>This brand of genetic determinism retains its allure for one reason: its political power. If it were possible to claim that entire groups of people are born stupid, lazy or in other ways inferior to other groups, governments would never need to fix their problems. Welfare or social improvements would be redundant because – let’s face it – poor families are destined to be poor, and their children are doomed at birth. Eugenics is a way of shirking responsibility for the origins of social problems, by casting blame on the disadvantaged. It suggests there is a natural order underpinning existing social hierarchies. Far better for them and the world, argues the eugenicist, that we let the poor die out. We need only look to the second world war for examples of what can happen when a group of people refuses to die fast enough: eugenicists helped them on their way.</p> <p>Beneath the policy proposals of leading eugenicists in the 19th and 20th centuries was a thinly veiled disgust for the poor, disabled and foreign. For more than a century the global eugenics movement has been built around the notion that those who are powerful and wealthy are there not because of privilege or good fortune, but because they are genetically better than everyone else. Eugenics was once the driving force behind the modern-day selective schooling system, which sifted children into ability buckets as early as possible in the belief they wouldn’t change. </p> <p>The rhetorical trick of those like Sabisky is to shift the argument away from moral defences of eugenics, which are no longer socially acceptable, and towards pseudoscientific justifications for eugenic practices. Claims that it’s possible to breed for beneficial traits in humans the same way we do with cows and dogs sound superficially plausible. But here, too, they are flawed. They ignore the physical price paid in genetic defects by these animals in meeting our demands for milk, meat and domestication. Pure-breed dogs, for example, <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/although-purebred-dogs-can-be-best-in-show-are-they-worst-in-health/\" title=\"\">frequently experience health issues</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/18/boris-johnson-panto-authoritarians-cruelty\">For Boris Johnson’s panto authoritarians, overt cruelty is a winning hand | Daniel Trilling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if we could breed humans for intelligence – itself unlikely given that intelligence involves many thousands of genes, social and environmental investment, and a significant dose of developmental luck – we could never be sure that a more intelligent population wouldn’t be genetically compromised in other ways. Animal breeding doesn’t create well-rounded individuals, it creates machines – and sometimes monsters.</p> <p>But, of course, this is not the point. What captivates Sabisky and Cummings is the notion of a fix, the dream that nonconformist geniuses will deliver bold technologies to save us from ourselves. Blinded by this light, they ignore the suffering and misery inflicted upon countless people by eugenicists who imagined they were acting for the national good. The technological fix was always a pipe dream. If policymakers truly cared about improving the lives of the poor and minorities, they would provide everyone with a high standard of nutrition and education, and root out nepotism and inequality of opportunity. It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out.</p> <p>• Angela Saini is a science journalist and the author of Superior: The Return of Race Science</p>",

Claims that it’s possible to breed for beneficial traits in humans the same way we do with cows and dogs sound superficially plausible. But here, too, they are flawed. They ignore the physical price paid in genetic defects by these animals in meeting our demands for milk, meat and domestication. Pure-breed dogs, for example, frequently experience health issues. Even if we could breed humans for intelligence – itself unlikely given that intelligence involves many thousands of genes, social and environmental investment, and a significant dose of developmental luck – we could never be sure that a more intelligent population wouldn’t be genetically compromised in other ways. Animal breeding doesn’t create well-rounded individuals, it creates machines – and sometimes monsters. But, of course, this is not the point. What captivates Sabisky and Cummings is the notion of a fix, the dream that nonconformist geniuses will deliver bold technologies to save us from ourselves. Blinded by this light, they ignore the suffering and misery inflicted upon countless people by eugenicists who imagined they were acting for the national good. The technological fix was always a pipe dream. If policymakers truly cared about improving the lives of the poor and minorities, they would provide everyone with a high standard of nutrition and education, and root out nepotism and inequality of opportunity. It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out. • Angela Saini is a science journalist and the author of Superior: The Return of Race Science"

          "bodyText":"The award-winning novelist Marian Keyes has been announced as one of the headline acts at a feminist literary festival where women are being encouraged to “marry” themselves. The Primadonna festival, which focuses on female writers to redress the gender inequality in publishing, is to follow the lead of the actor Emma Watson in celebrating self-partnering. Watson famously used the phrase in a Vogue interview describing how she was happy to be single, adding: “I call it being self-partnered.” Now organisers of the second Primadonna festival, to be held in Suffolk from 31 July to 2 August, have announced it will feature an alternative wedding chapel where festival-goers can book in to wed themselves. And anyone who makes a donation to the Primadonna festival GoFundMe page on Saturday 29 February – the leap year day when women are traditionally encouraged to pop the question to their partners – will be in with a chance to self-partner in style courtesy of the festival. Keyes, the international bestselling author, whose books include Watermelon and The Mystery of Mercy Close will be among the headliners for this year’s Primadonna, organisers said on Friday. Keyes, whose bestselling books include Watermelon and The Mystery of Mercy Close, said: “I’m really excited to be part of the festival, as I love what it’s doing to open up the literary world to new audiences. I’m going to be talking about love, comedy, writing and everything in between: I understand that nothing’s out of bounds at the Primadonna festival (what a challenge!).

In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.</p>\n    <p>Global heating does not influence all extreme weather – natural variability still exists. <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world\">Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies</a> and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Most TV and newspaper reports have covered these events in jaunty tones with images of scantily clad sun-seekers, children with melting ice-creams and sweating holidaymakers downing cold drinks on the beach.

In May 2019, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\">destruction of the ecosystems</a>&nbsp;that support all life on Earth.</p>\n    <p>The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, says: “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.”</p>\n    <p>Other terms that have been updated include the use of “wildlife” rather than “biodiversity”, “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” and “climate science denier” rather than “climate sceptic”.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/damiancarrington\"><b>Damian Carrington</b></a> <i>Environment editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Other experts said the Met Office, along with the BBC, should go further and be proactive about linking the weather with the climate.</p> \n<p>“At the moment, the Met Office seems to be afraid to talk about climate change.

          "body":"<p>Not a Bond film. In Damien Hirst’s celebrated creation, <a href=\"http://www.damienhirst.com/\">The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</a> was a tiger shark suspended in a tank. In this brief, ruminative piece from Thai film-maker <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3849565/\">Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit</a>, that impossibility is something else – it’s the formaldehyde that the shark’s floating in, or that we’re all floating in, or it’s the banal glass tank itself, or it’s the people milling around the artwork in the gallery, peering at it, shrugging, and then leaving to get on with their day.</p> <p>This feature is a collection of short stories or realist vignettes, based on or otherwise inspired by newspaper stories about tragic or bizarre deaths. A story about a female student killed by a truck that careered off the road – a woman who, just a few moments before, had been hanging out with her friends in a hotel room and had volunteered to step out to get beer – is dramatised with a simple scene showing the ordinary, undramatic, untragic hanging out: chatting, laughing. Later, a maid silently comes to clean the empty room.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxynNV-Etyg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BxynNV-Etyg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A story about a man who takes his own life after posting something about it on Facebook leads us to the cold way his ex-girlfriend had been treating him. But he had sort of been stalking her, so things aren’t as simple as they appear. There are many other scenes like this, in which death is eerily right around the corner, just when normality had seemed impregnable.

          "bodyText":"Not a Bond film. In Damien Hirst’s celebrated creation, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living was a tiger shark suspended in a tank. In this brief, ruminative piece from Thai film-maker Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit, that impossibility is something else – it’s the formaldehyde that the shark’s floating in, or that we’re all floating in, or it’s the banal glass tank itself, or it’s the people milling around the artwork in the gallery, peering at it, shrugging, and then leaving to get on with their day. This feature is a collection of short stories or realist vignettes, based on or otherwise inspired by newspaper stories about tragic or bizarre deaths. A story about a female student killed by a truck that careered off the road – a woman who, just a few moments before, had been hanging out with her friends in a hotel room and had volunteered to step out to get beer – is dramatised with a simple scene showing the ordinary, undramatic, untragic hanging out: chatting, laughing. Later, a maid silently comes to clean the empty room. A story about a man who takes his own life after posting something about it on Facebook leads us to the cold way his ex-girlfriend had been treating him. But he had sort of been stalking her, so things aren’t as simple as they appear. There are many other scenes like this, in which death is eerily right around the corner, just when normality had seemed impregnable. But then that is what death is – it renders our response irrelevant. In Larkin’s words: no different whined at than withstood. There is an interview with an old man who is 104, who says he wouldn’t mind dying, but is lucid enough to rebuke young people for not making the most of their lives. Die Tomorrow is about the most important subject there is; the subject that, as the years go by, we spend more and more of our time trying not to think about. But it is always there. Perhaps this film should have been longer, to do justice to the theme. Yet no length is epic enough. • Die Tomorrow is released in the UK on 26 July."
